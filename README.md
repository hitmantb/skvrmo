Best way to show your appreciation is to endorse on Nexus and post images/videos of this mod list on Reddit/Youtube.  

This modlist is designed for 3060TI and up.  I am playing on 11700 + 3070, Virtual Desktop Ultra (1.5x native Quest 2 resolution which shines with FSR upscaling), 45 FPS reprojected to 90.  For all crash issues, drop crash<dateTime stamp>.log from My Documents\Skyrim VR\SKSE in chat.  All other issues, specify GPU and headset.

###Installation

•Antivirus will occasionally flag Wabbajack files or even textures from Nexus, it is safe to ignore, please see Wabbajack Discord for this well known issue.  You may need to whitelist the directory it installs to as well as the downloads
•You do not EVER need to delete and install a Wabbajack list from scratch, it is a 100% file sync
•Typical download errors are caused by Nexus server issues.  Quit Wabbajack, restart, overwrite to resume and you won't lose any progress
•If the error is about a file that should be part of standard Skyrim installation, set the game to English, do a Steam file validation
•Do not sort plugins with LOOT, restore plugin order with back arrow on plugin tab if you messed it up.  

###Starting The Game

•AMD/GTX users disable DLAA and Nvidia Reflex in MO2 mods to avoid hard crash.  Enable TAA in game to compensate
•Always start the game with Play Game (SKSE) in MO2, do not open Steam VR ahead of the time.  If MO2 gets stuck before opening Steam VR, close MO2 and end all VR Server related processes in task manager
•Disable Dynamic Resolution in Game! 
•Steam resolution 100% for Oculus users, use VD or Oculus app resolution scaling instead.  Super sampling in game lowest on slider for all  
•When starting new game, stand still wait for all the start-up scripts to run and finish if you are using NSFW version
•Oculus/Pico users, I strongly recommend Virtual Desktop
•If you must use Oculus Link, Airlink, or use another headset, see section on Open Composite XR
